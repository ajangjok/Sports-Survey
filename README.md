README: Sports Survey Questionnaire Dataset

Overview

This README file provides information about the Sports Survey Questionnaire Dataset and the corresponding R analysis script for cleaning, exploring, and analyzing the data.

File Description

1. Excel File: sports_survey_questionnaire_-_all_versions_-_labels_-_Cleaning - Copy (3).xlsx
2. 
•	Purpose: Raw dataset containing responses from a sports survey.

•	Format: Excel file with labeled columns representing survey responses and metadata.

•	Sheet Details:

o	If the file has multiple sheets, describe them here (e.g., "Sheet1" contains raw survey data, "Sheet2" contains metadata").

•	Columns:

o	<Column Name 1>: Description of the variable (e.g., "Age of participants").

o	<Column Name 2>: Description of the variable (e.g., "Preferred sport of participants").



o	<Column Name 3>: Description of the variable (e.g., "Frequency of playing sports per week").

•	Missing Values: Indicate columns with missing values and how they were handled during cleaning.

4. R Script: Sports_Survey_Analysis.R
5. 
•	Purpose: An R script to clean, explore, and analyze the dataset.

•	Dependencies:

o	readxl: For reading the Excel file.

o	dplyr: For data manipulation.

o	ggplot2: For creating visualizations.

•	Output:

o	Cleaned dataset: Cleaned_Sports_Survey_Data.csv.

o	Summary statistics and visualizations.

Analysis Workflow

Excel Workflow

1.	Open the file using spreadsheet software (e.g., Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets).
3.	Review the column names, data types, and completeness of the da
5.	Note: Use proper methods to handle missing values if working directly in Excel.
R Workflow
1.	Load the R script (Sports_Survey_Analysis.R) in RStudio or another R IDE.
2.	Install the required packages if not already installed:
R
Copy code
install.packages(c("readxl", "dplyr", "ggplot2"))
3.	Run the script to perform:
o	Data Import: Load the Excel file.
o	Data Cleaning:
	Handle missing values by either dropping rows or imputing with median values.
	Remove duplicate records.
o	Descriptive Analysis:
	Calculate summary statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation.
o	Visualization:
	Create bar plots for categorical data.
	Generate histograms and boxplots for numerical data.
o	Export cleaned data as Cleaned_Sports_Survey_Data.csv.

Output Files
1.	Cleaned Dataset:
o	File Name: Cleaned_Sports_Survey_Data.csv.
o	Description: Cleaned version of the dataset with missing values handled and duplicates removed.
o	Format: CSV file for use in further analysis or other software.
2.	Visualizations:
o	Description: Plots created using the ggplot2 library in R, saved to the working directory or displayed in the R console.
o	Example Plots:
	Bar plots showing distribution of survey responses for categorical variables.
	Histograms depicting the frequency of numerical variables.
	Boxplots comparing numerical variables across categories.

Notes
•	Ensure the column names in the R script match those in the Excel file.
•	Customize the R script to align with your specific analytical goals (e.g., modifying plot labels, bin sizes, or summary calculations).
•	The workflow assumes basic familiarity with R and data analysis.
